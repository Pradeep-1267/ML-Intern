This yolo model identifies teeth deposits
input images should be only teeth_area, few sample input images are provided in images folder
deposit_identifier.py contains teeth_deposit_identifier class, which can be used to identify teeth deposits
method to call:
  "from deposit_identifier import teeth_deposit_identifier
  "pred = teeth_deposit_identifier()
  "res = pred.predict(path , th_1 = 0.6 , th_2 = 0.6 , display=True)"
path should be path of the image
th_1 is the bounding boxes threshold
th_2 is the non-max supression threshold
if display is set true, then bounding boxes are visualized
